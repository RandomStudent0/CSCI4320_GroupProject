"# CSCI4320_GroupProject" 


Hi everyone, before commits, please create a new branch.
!!!!!Also, we might not actually need it. If everyone agrees, we can just only use the main branch for coding.!!!!!
Using the github website, click on:
Branch -> New Branch -> Firstname-Lastname
(Remove this once everyone has done it and before we submit it)

Then, we will use git checkout branch_name to checkout our branch.

However, if that does not work, we will use git checkout -b Firstname-Lastname to create the new branch.
Then, we will do git checkout -b branchname to get into it. Then, do git pull origin branchname to get the code from the main branch.
